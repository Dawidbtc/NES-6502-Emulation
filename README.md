<h1>6502 NES Emulator</h1>
<p>This is part of a project that I've been working on after being inspired by a video I watched from javidx9 on youtube of a full NES emulator he built.</p> 

<p>I decided to take on the challenge myself and try to create my own fully functioning emulator</p> 

<p>This is the first part of my emulator which emulates a MOS 6502 cpu not including decimal mode. </p> 
<p>This cpu emulation uses all the addressable memory in the ranges of 0x0000-0xFFFF as RAM. </p>
